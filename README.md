Hi, my name is Ravi Vasudev Makhija, born in Edison, NJ, U.S.A., and I believe a transceiver or transceiver-like object was put in me (connected to my brain or nervous system) at some point in the past. I was unaware of this until later in life. 

One implication of this is that I believe the thoughts which occur in my mind are transmitted somewhere and made available to someone or some people, where it is likely then decoded, perhaps as text, audio, or even video. It is likely that this has been going on for many years. 

I am typing this on Saturday, October 25, 2025, with my macbook and iPhone. This is the first time I am revealing this in a way that is accessible to the public.

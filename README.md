Hi, my name is Ravi Vasudev Makhija, born in Edison, NJ, U.S.A., and I believe a transceiver or transceiver-like object was put in me (connected to my brain or nervous system) at some point in the past. I was unaware of this until later in life. 

One consequence of this is that I believe the thoughts which occur in my mind are transmitted somewhere and made available to someone or some people, where it is likely then decoded, perhaps as text, audio, or even video. It is likely that this has been going on for many years. For instance, if I "voice" a password in my mind as I'm logging in to an online service, the password would then be known to any person(s) with access to the transmitted signal and the means to decode it. 

There might be other consequences. In particular, a second consequence I believe is that my thoughts could be affected by signals that are sent to this object in me, influencing my behavior. 

I am typing this on Saturday, October 25, 2025, with my macbook and iPhone. This is the first time I am revealing this in a way that is accessible to the public.
